        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Over a year ago, in between working full time and being a new mom, I listened to an audio book called The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century, by Dickson Despommier. To date, this book has been the culmination of my growing obsession with food--namely where it comes from, how it is processed (or not), and how nutritious it is for my family.</p>

<p>I began learning more about indoor and small-space gardening. I learned about the sustainability of our current food systems. I began imagining which walls I would line with my vertical gardens, I watched video after video about how to start your own hydroponic, aquaponic, or aeroponic growing system. I was inspired by the innovation I was seeing, and even more by the changes I knew could come about.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw one setup that was automated. Someone had their hydroponics decked out with solar panels, pH and temperature sensors, automated water pumps, you name it, and any time anything went wrong, the system sent him an email. That's powerful, I thought to myself, and completely replicable.</p>

<p>The only caveat was that I was not a programmer. But I was approaching a place in my career where I was becoming so envious of the programmers I was working with, and envious of all the exploration they get to do, pushing into the future the way most of the non-programmers rarely get to do, that I decided to make a huge move. I quit my job and I enrolled at the Turing School of Software and Design.</p>

<p>So here I am, learning how to program things. Right now, it's just solving small challenges and catching up with the rest of the world. But give me time, and the challenges will be more impressive.</p>
